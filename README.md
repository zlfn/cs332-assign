## Develpment Environment
![Scala](https://img.shields.io/badge/scala-%23DC322F.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=scala&logoColor=white)
![Sbt](https://img.shields.io/badge/sbt-%235e150f.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=apachenetbeanside&logoColor=white)

* I manage my development environment with [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise)  
You can check tools' versions and environment variables in [.mise.toml](./.mise.toml)

```nu
mise install
mise trust
mise set
```

```nu
sbt test
sbt run
```

* My IDE is Neovim, and you can find configurations in [here](https://github.com/zlfn/nvim-config)  
I use metals as Scala lsp. But this is not important for building the program.

## Trivia
Scala is too fun to wait build
